            <p>Beloved beyond all names and forms,<br>
            You dwell where the mind cannot reach.<br>
            When I searched the world for You,<br>
            I found You waiting quietly within my breath.</p>

            <p>You are the wine that makes the soul forget its wounds,<br>
            the fire that turns longing into prayer.<br>
            When I fall apart, You gather me again<br>
            without asking why I broke.</p>

            <p>Every step I take is already held by You,<br>
            every tear knows the way to Your ocean.<br>
            I thought I was alone in this vast night—<br>
            but even my loneliness was Your embrace.</p>

            <p>You speak through silence,<br>
            You answer before the question is born.<br>
            In my weakness, You are strength;<br>
            in my emptiness, You arrive as fullness.</p>

            <p class="get-well">💕 Get Well Soon Love 💕</p>
